## Description
A project built with React to implement a simple weather app. The app displays the high and low temperatures for five days,
the current weather condition, the time, a dynamic weather icon and a gradient background.

## Data
To obtain the data, an API call is made. Then, the data is broken down into five dictionaries for five days. Each dictionary contains
the forecast for that day in intervals of 3 hours. There are other interesting features of the data that were not used.

## Icons
To present the forecast to the visitor, an icon is displayed for each 3 hour interval. Not only does the icon change but its
description is updated. Also, icons for day and night exist based on the same conditions. This was possible by manipulating the 
state of the components and timing the changes correctly.

## Gradients
To further improve the experience of the visitor, gradient colors are added to the backgrounds of each day. The gradients 
slowly change the color from night to day. The gradient is also subject to the 3 hour intervals.
